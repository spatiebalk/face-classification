# Face Classification 
Fien Ockers, march 2020

Project for my AI thesis regarding binary syndrome classification of faces of people with Intellectual Disability. 

General steps:
1. Selecting ID controls and saving them as well as the patient images.
2. Saving the representations for all images in csv files.
3. Running the main classifier file which tries multiple classifiers (knn, svm, random forest, gradient boost and ada boost).
