    "This notebook runs 3 different scripts. It first selects the controls, then saves the representation and finally calls the classifier script which saves the results. By giving the trial nr, you can seperate the results for each trial to see whether the results are consistent. The images aren't saved for each trial but overwritten, and an overview of the selected controls (and all patients) is saved so it can be reconstructed."
